# Crypto_Algorithms
## Hash Functions:
- SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit): Used in Bitcoin and many other
  crytocurrencies for creating digital signatures and hashing transactions.
  It Produces a fixed-size output (256 bits) regardless of the input size.

## Public Key Cryptography:
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography : ECC is widely used in cryptocurrencies for
  creating public and private key pairs.
