# Cloud-native applications
## Microservices Architecture:
- Break down the application into small, independent services(microservices).
- Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability.
- Enables easier development, deployment, and scaling of individual components.
## Scalability and Elasticity:
- Design applications to scale horizontally by adding more instances of microservices.
- Leverage auto-scaling features of cloud platforms to adapt to varying workloads.
